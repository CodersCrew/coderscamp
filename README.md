## What is CodersCamp?
CodersCamp is a 6 month long, free, and open web development bootcamp organized in Poland by the CodersCrew Association. Our mission is to guide everyone from the first lines of code to a career as a web developer. During the course, participants receive an interactive learning plan containing 5 modules:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript - web development basics.
- Scalable web applications with TypeScript.
- Creating REST API clients with Node.js.
- Single-page applications with React.js.
- Module of choice
  - Advanced back-end development with Nest.js.
  - Advanced front-end development with Redux.js.

CodersCamp students work in 6-people teams guided by an experienced mentor. After each module, each team creates a fully-featured web application. As a result, each student has a portfolio of 5 practical projects with live demos at the end of the course. The entire bootcamp ends with a 24h hackathon where participants create an application that meets business requirements specified by the hackathon's partner.
